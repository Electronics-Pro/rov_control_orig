# RoV_ThrusterControlSystem

main file is rov_control
right now the all it does is fires the main thruster (m3 @full speed) forward once the right bumper is pushed and stops firing once it is released,
left bumper does the same to the main thruster but backwards

These thruster controls depend on two major libaries: the xbox360controller libary which handels input from the xbox controller via usb and the MotorControllerHAT which controls the motor controller output

The majority of these files are redundant, but kept for compatability issues. Ill prune the files once I get the software to an apporpriate level.
